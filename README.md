# Computational cognitive modeling - Fall 2023 - first three workgroups

**Instructors**: [Jeshua Tromp](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/jeshua-tromp#tab-1) and [Philippa Johnson](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/medewerkers/philippa-johnson#tab-1)

**Summary**: 

There are two competing computational hypotheses for how humans categorize. In this workshop you will learn how to test and assess these hypotheses in order to reason which computational hypothesis best explains the human capacity of categorization.

**Set-up**

We will use Pyhon 3 and Jupyter Notebooks during the workgroups. To get everything up and running:
- Download the homeworks/homework-Categorization folder (https://github.com/JeshuaT/CM-fall2022/tree/master/homeworks/homework-Categorization). You can do this by pasting the link into https://downgit.github.io/
- (if you haven't done so in the previous workgroup): Install Jupyter Notebooks in your favorite Python IDE (https://jupyter.org/install)
- Unzip the downloaded folder and open it in your Python IDE with Jupyter Notebooks installed
- Download any remaining packages that are not in your Python3 folder yet

You can also use Google Colab to access and run the Jupyter Notebooks without downloading anything:

[Part A](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JeshuaT/CM-fall2023/blob/master/homeworks/homework-Categorization/Homework-Categorization-PartA.ipynb)

[Part B](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JeshuaT/CM-fall2023/blob/master/homeworks/homework-Categorization/Homework-Categorization-PartB.ipynb)


Note that these are suggestions. If you have another way of running/editing a Jupyer Notebook, you are more than welcome to use that. Make sure however that you do run it in a way that, in the end, you can save your Jupyter notebook.

**Handing-in**

Hand in an html of both the Homework-Categorization-PartA.ipynb and the Homework-Categorization-PartB.ipynb on Brightspace.
