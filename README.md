# Computational cognitive modeling - Fall 2022 - first three workgroups

**Instructors**: [Jeshua Tromp](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/jeshua-tromp#tab-1) and [Beth Lloyd](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/beth-lloyd#tab-1)

**Summary**: 

**Set-up**

We will use Pyhon 3 and Jupyter Notebooks during the workgroups. To get everything up and running:
- Download the homeworks/homework-Categorization folder (https://github.com/JeshuaT/CM-fall2022/tree/master/homeworks/homework-Categorization). You can do this by pasting the link into https://downgit.github.io/
- Install Jupyter Notebooks in your favorite Python IDE (https://jupyter.org/install)
- Unzip the downloaded folder and open it in your Python IDE with Jupyter Notebooks installed
- Download any remaining packages that are not in your Python3 folder yet

Note that these are suggestions. If you have another way of running/editing a Jupyer Notebook, you are more than welcome to use that. Make sure however that you do run it in a way that, in the end, you can make a PDF of your Jupyter notebook.

**Handing-in**

Hand in an html of Homework-Categorization-PartA.ipynb on Brightspace.
